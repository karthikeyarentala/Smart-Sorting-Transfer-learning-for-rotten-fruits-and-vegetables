# Smart-Sorting-Transfer-learning-for-rotten-fruits-and-vegetables
Full stack python project to classify rotten and healthy fruits and vegetables using Flask
In this, We train the model using VGG16 Transfer learning model method in the file "project.py". 
I've trained the model and saved it as 'healthy_vs_rotten.h5' file, and imported this model in the Flask app "app.py"
To run the Flask app "app.py", first we've to run the model "project.py". 
This model gives the output with an accuracy of approximately above 95% for any random input image
